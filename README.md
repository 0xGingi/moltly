# Moltly

A cozy molt logbook and reminder center for tarantula keepers. Keep every shed, enclosure tweak, and follow-up in one placeâ€”credentials or Discord sign-in gets you to the same dashboard.

## Highlights

- Home dashboard shows active spiders, molt pace this year, the most recent shed, and the next reminder at a glance.
- Twelve-month timeline breaks down molt streaks with stage counts so you can spot quiet months fast.
- Reminder center lets you snooze or clear follow-ups without leaving the page.
- Full CRUD for molt entries with search, stage filtering, and asc/desc sorting.
- Inline attachment support for quick photo drops.
- Auth powered by NextAuth with classic email/password and Discord.
